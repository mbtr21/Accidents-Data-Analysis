https://github.com/mbtr21/Accidents-Data-Analysis

## Usage
To run the application, execute the main script:
python main.py
This will preprocess the data, perform hypothesis testing, run the predictive model, and launch the dashboard for data visualization.
## Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares data for analysis, including encoding, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction.
Hypothesis Testing: Performs statistical tests to analyze data features and relationships.
Predictive Modeling: Utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for making predictions.
Interactive Dashboard: Visualizes data and analysis results interactively using Dash and Plotly
Dashboard : A simple pdf of dashboard
